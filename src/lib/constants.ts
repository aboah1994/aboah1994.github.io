Our proposed method won 7th place in the 2023 AI City Challenge, Track 5, with an mAP score of 0.5861 on experimental validation data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed system.",

Previous approaches have treated vehicle maneuver detection as a classification problem, although both time series segmentation and classification are required since input telemetry data is continuous. Our objective is to develop an end-to-end pipeline for frame-by-frame annotation of naturalistic driving studies videos into various driving events including stop and lane keeping events, lane changes, left-right turning movements, and horizontal curve maneuvers.",
